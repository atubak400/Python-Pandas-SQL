Example 2
Listed Company ABC is an online retailer selling clothes and jewellery. 
It has 50million rows of sales transactions (i.e. customer orders) in the year 2022. 
After I remove all the returned orders and their original orders in Example 1, I will obtain a cleansed listing.

Now I need to reconcile all the customer order amounts to the relevant bank receipts. 
I’ve obtained a detailed breakdown of ABC’s bank statements for the year 2022, 
which have translated various customer currencies to USD. 
My questions:

1.	How shall I match the cleansed sales listing with the breakdown of bank statements?
2.	How shall I calculate the subtotal of all the customer order amounts (USD) matching bank receipts, 
and the subtotal of those (USD) not matching bank receipts?

See an example of the breakdown of bank statements: SQL – Example 2 >>> the tab ‘Bank Statements’.
See an example of ABC’s register of when customers made payments for each order: SQL – Example 2 >>> the tab ‘Order ID to Payment Date’
